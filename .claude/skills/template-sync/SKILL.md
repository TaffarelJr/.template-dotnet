  Reviews and resolves a Template Sync pull request - the automated merge that
  brings changes down from this repo's parent template. Use when a
  "Merge changes from template repo" PR appears, when one is marked NEEDS
  RESOLUTION, or when asked why a sync is failing.

Template Sync merges the parent template's `main` into a `template-sync`
branch and opens a PR. Read `scripts/README.md` for how the chain fits
together before resolving anything.

## 1. Find out what it wants to change

`gh pr list --head template-sync` then `gh pr diff <n>`.

Say what the PR contains before touching it. Three shapes, and they need
different responses:

- **Nothing.** A clean sync opens no PR at all. A PR with an empty diff means
  something odd happened — investigate rather than merge.
- **Genuine upstream changes.** The parent improved something. This is the
  normal case.
- **Conflicts** — the PR title starts `NEEDS RESOLUTION`. The workflow pushed
  the branch with conflict markers still in it.

## 2. Resolve conflicts by asking who owns the file

This is the whole judgement, and getting it backwards is how a repo loses its
own customizations or drifts from its template.

- **`scripts/Helpers.psm1`, `scripts/New-Repo.ps1` — the template, always.**
  These must stay byte-identical at every layer. If this repo edited one, that
  edit was the mistake; move it into a `Helpers-<NN>-<slug>.psm1` instead.
- **`.github/settings.yml` — this repo.** It declares only its own deltas.
  The rest is inherited through `_extends` at runtime, not through the file.
- **`.github/workflows/template-sync.yml` — split.** This repo owns
  `TEMPLATE_REPO_URL` and the schedule; the template owns the steps.
- **`README.md` — split.** This repo owns the diagram highlight and its own
  tables; the template owns the shared structure.
- **`LICENSE` — this repo**, if it is private and carries the proprietary
  notice. Otherwise the template.
- **`Helpers-*.psm1`, `.claude/`, `docs/` — whichever side changed.** These
  are additive, so a conflict usually means both sides edited the same line.
  Read both before choosing.
- **Anything else — prefer the template**, and treat the conflict as a signal
  that this repo customized something it should not have.

Resolve locally: check out the branch, fix the markers, and verify before
pushing. Never resolve by taking one whole side blindly.

## 3. Verify before merging

- `git grep -n '<<<<<<<'` finds nothing.
- Scripts still parse, and the module still imports with the export count you
  expect.
- The required checks pass on the branch.
- The result is still byte-identical to the parent for the files the table
  says the template owns. Diff them explicitly:
  `git diff template/main -- scripts/Helpers.psm1` should be empty.

## 4. Merge, then check the next layer

Merge the PR. If this repo is itself a template, its own descendants will not
see the change until *their* sync runs — so say which repos are now behind,
and offer to dispatch their syncs.

## If the workflow itself failed

Read the run: `gh run view <id> --log-failed`. The usual causes are a
`TEMPLATE_REPO_URL` pointing at the wrong repo (it is inherited verbatim, so
a level-2 repo can end up syncing from its grandparent), a ruleset blocking
the push of the `template-sync` branch, or the parent having no `main`.
